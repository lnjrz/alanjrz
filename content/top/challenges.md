#### #TidyTuesday {#tidytuesday}

The [R4DS ("R for Data Science") online learning community](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity) founded by [Jesse Maegan](https://www.jessemaegan.com/) is a great opportunity to train skills related to data wrangling and visualization and forms a network of mentors and learners. One of the first projects born out of this collaboration is [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md), a weekly social data project founded by [Thomas Mock](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) that focusses on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `{ggplot2}`, `{tidyr}`, `{dplyr}` and other tools in the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem.
Every Tuesday, R enthusiasts from all over the world clean, wrangle, tidy and visualize a new data set and [share it on Twitter using the hashtag #TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typd). The intent is to provide a safe and supportive forum to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills.

Since 2019, I contribute to the #TidyTuesday to train my data science skills. It is so much fun to follow this project and to share ideas and codes - and of course to get inspired by the other contributions!
