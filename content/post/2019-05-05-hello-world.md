Hi, I am glad you found your way here! Come in, have a look.

I finally managed to set up a personal homepage - and how easy it was! Huge thanks to the developers of the R package [`{blogdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Presmanes Hill and the open-source [Hugo framework](https://gohugo.io/). Much thanks also to [Huabing Zhao](https://github.com/zhaohuabing) for sharing his ["CleanWhite" theme](https://github.com/zhaohuabing/hugo-theme-cleanwhite)!
